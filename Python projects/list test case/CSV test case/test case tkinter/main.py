Program: Password Manager
Last Date Edited: 20250430

Program Details:
This program is a password manager built to incorporate the tkinter and cryptography library.

This program features:
-Password Generation
-Creating, saving, and deleting titles of entries to a CSV file.
-Deleting Entries.
-Decrypts and Encrypts CSV file using a symmetric key.
-The program acts as an interpreter for the key and the user does not need to manually decrypt/encrypt.

The program runs out of the root window and opens other functions in different window(new_window).
Most of the logic originated from the password Generator instruction and was translated to use
widgets in tkinter library. Certain functions such as the accounts viewer were added later
after basic functions were proven to work.

Chat-GPT was used for adding a PNG image w/ transparent values on the main window and is annotated
accordingly. Any other use of AI was to verify syntax errors not noted in IDEs such as VScode and standard
Python terminals. 

Most of the resources used were from Youtube, W3schools.com, and forums pertaining to coding including
reddit.com, GeeksforGeeks.com, and Stack Overflow.  
All resources used will be included in technical documentation for this program.

Notes: 
-All functions working
-Encryption command fixed in root windows's "close" widget.
-CSV file can be written and saved. No error in encryption/decryption.
-Key is working.

Potential issues:

-titles can be repeated/ if one title is deleted, several of the same can be deleted at once.
-closing program can potentially corrupt file (from crashes and manually ending program).
-
-if key is manipulated, a new key must be generated.
-code can be restructered/simplified for developer side.
